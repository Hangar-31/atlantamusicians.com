      Earn an Associate Degree — completely online, for FREE! Even if you don’t
      qualify for student financial aid, the Union Plus Free College Benefit
      will be applied to your balance for tuition, fees and e-books. Under an
      academic partnership with Eastern Gateway Community College (EGCC), the
      Union Plus Free College Benefit offers grants — known as "last dollar
      scholarships" — that fill the gap between any federal, state and employer
      education grants for tuition, fees, and e-books for certain online
      programs at Eastern Gateway.


      Eastern Gateway Community College is a fully accredited, non-profit public institution that is part of the University System of Ohio. Students can enroll in the distance learning program from anywhere in the U.S. The program offers ten associate degrees and two certificate programs. Credits can be transferred to a four-year college.
