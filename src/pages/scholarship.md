      For our 2020 auditions, we had 14 talented musicians audition, though in a
      slightly different format than typical. We would like to wish all the
      young musicians for submitting their audition videos, and we know they all
      have a bright future ahead of them.


      We would also like to thank our 2020 Scholarship judging panel of Local 148-462 musicians: Karen Vaughn-Smith, Shadwa Mussad, and Eric Hawkins.
