      As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow and increasingly alter the
      daily lives of musicians across the state of Georgia, Atlanta Federation
      of Musicians recognizes the great need for support. As an organization,
      your physical and mental health and safety, as well as the health and
      safety of our community, are top priorities.

      We have seen the devastating financial impacts this virus has had on the arts, creating an industry-wide work stoppage across the country. Below, we have assembled some resources and references for musicians, union and non-union, to reach out to for assistance.
