      Every day the AFM helps thousands of musicians — negotiating fair
      agreements, protecting ownership of recorded music, securing benefits such
      as health care and pension, or lobbying our legislators. The AFM is
      committed to raising industry standards and placing the professional
      musician in the foreground of the cultural landscape.


      Organized in 1901, the Atlanta Federation of Musicians is a significant chapter of the AFM representing around 700 musicians throughout Georgia, including the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Athens, Augusta, Columbus and Macon. Our professional members perform every imaginable style of music – including blues, classical, country, ethnic/world music, hip-hop, jazz, rap, rock, soul.
