    text: The Music Performance Trust Fund (MPTF) was established in 1948 as a
      nonprofit independent public service organization whose mission includes
      contributing to the public knowledge and appreciation of music, as well as
      making music a part of every childâ€™s life experience. Headquartered in New
      York City, the tax-exempt MPTF, operating under section 501(c) 3 of the
      Internal Revenue Code, evolved from a landmark collective bargaining
      agreement between the American Federation of Musicians and the major
      recording companies of the day. Today the MPTF is a vital organization
      that brings music to the public and supplements the income of musicians,
      all at no cost to those receiving this precious gift of music.
