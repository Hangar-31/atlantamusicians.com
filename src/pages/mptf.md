    text: The Music Performance Trust Fund (MPTF) was established in 1948 as a
      nonprofit independent public service organization whose mission includes
      contributing to the public knowledge and appreciation of music, as well as
      making music a part of every childâ€™s life experience. Headquartered in New
      York City, the tax-exempt MPTF, operating under section 501(c) 3 of the
      Internal Revenue Code, evolved from a landmark collective bargaining
      agreement between the American Federation of Musicians and the major
      recording companies of the day. Today the MPTF is a vital organization
      that brings music to the public and supplements the income of musicians,
      all at no cost to those receiving this precious gift of music.

    text: This year the Music Performance Trust Fund presented over 2,000 live,
      admission-free musical programs. An impressive figure, although
      considerably lower than in previous years, due to our loss of income
      caused by illegal downloading and piracy. Nevertheless, the Fund remains
      the largest provider of free, musical programs for audiences representing
      every ethnic, economic, social and age group. Our music reaches deep into
      communities touching the lives of so many; bringing joy to the lonely in
      nursing homes, bittersweet memories to our vets, hope to at-risk and
      incarcerated young men and women and songs to children-many who have never
      experienced live music.

      As music programs in schools continue to decline, the Music Performance
      Trust Fund has been increasing its support and commitment in this area. At
      present, approximately 35% of available funds are earmarked for in-school
      programming. The MPTF is proud to co-sponsor programs that not only
      present live music to the children, but also incorporate historic,
      instrumental and theoretical workshops. To continue its funding of these
      invaluable programs, MPTF is broadening its local and nationwide search
      for philanthropic support. 


      This year, the MPTF expanded our support in education with a special campaign to introduce new local programs.  The initiative included over $140,000 of new funding to fully sponsor 172 additional educational performance events in 21 U.S. cities and in seven Canadian metropolitan areas.

    text: The Music Performance Trust Fund has a long-standing tradition of
      providing music entertainment for senior citizens. Although older
      enthusiasts enjoy our park events, community concerts, and symphonic
      performances, we have strived to connect more deeply and more intimately
      with our aging population, who face growing economic, mobility, and social
      challenges. In 2015, the MPTF developed a program called MusicianFest as
      an umbrella covering free senior center performances

    title: How to Apply
  - type: section_content_text
    text: >
      To apply for an MPTF grant, seek the assistance of the Local office. We
      can help in planning and organizing your event.


      Recipients of grants are required to handle the necessary payroll requirements of hiring professional musicians, including appropriate payments to pension funds and taxes. We will provide the financial and contact information necessary to make this happen.


      MPTF-funded events must be free of charge and without any conditions for admittance. They cannot be fund-raising events or raffles regardless of the merit. 


      We require grant applications be submitted at least 30 days prior to the performance. Grant recipients should include the MPTF in event programs, press releases, websites, posted signs, and other public notifications, along with other event sponsors.


      Once the event happens, the MPTF requires written certification that the performance was completed, upon which grant payments are initiated.
