      Every day the AFM helps thousands of musicians — negotiating fair
      agreements, protecting ownership of recorded music, securing benefits such
      as health care and pension, or lobbying our legislators. The AFM is
      committed to raising industry standards and placing the professional
      musician in the foreground of the cultural landscape.


      Organized in 1901, the Atlanta Federation of Musicians is a significant chapter of the AFM representing around 700 musicians throughout Georgia, including the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Athens, Augusta, Columbus and Macon. Our professional members perform every imaginable style of music – including blues, classical, country, ethnic/world music, hip-hop, jazz, rap, rock, soul.

        title: President
        text: >
          BRUCE KENNEY joined the Atlanta Federation of Musicians in 1985, and
          has served as President since 2015. He first joined the AFM Houston
          local in 1975, working as a bass guitarist. Shifting to orchestral
          work as a French horn player, he eventually joined the Atlanta
          Symphony. 

          His freelance years depended on per service income in pop and classical performance. Working freelancers in all genres stand to benefit greatly from collaborative thinking, and the AFM provides the needed structure. For specific workplaces, AFM collective bargaining agreements further solidify terms of employment. 

          His goal as President is to get the right conversations in progress so that musicians can decide how best to deal with the concerns of their professional lives. He encourages the Board to examine, with an open mind, ways to identify and inspire these voices.

          DR. JAMES HARDY PATTERSON earned his BA Degree in Music from Clark
          College (now Clark Atlanta University) in 1957. In 1965 Dr. Patterson
          earned his Masters of Music Degree from the University of Michigan. He
          received an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Morris Brown College in
          2018.


          ​Throughout Dr. Patterson's undergraduate years, he engaged in developing and refining his musical talent under Professor Wayman Carver (first to record the flute in jazz) the Band Director at then Clark College.

The premise of its founding is to preserve and promote "African diaspora history/culture," jazz, in the purest state. The Clark Atlanta University Jazz Orchestra is free of electronic technology or fusion with other genres.


          Under Associate Professor Dr. Patterson's direction, the orchestra has performed locally, nationally and internationally with numerous jazz artists, among them James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmy Heath, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Ellis Marsalis, Lalo Schifrin, Quincy Jones, and Lionel Hampton. Over the years, the group has also performed with such legendary artists as Jon Faddis, Frank Foster, Kenny Burrell, Mary Lou Williams, Nancy Wilson, Sarah Vaughn, Illinois Jacquet, and Clark Terry. Since 1981, the CAU Jazz Orchestra has performed eight times at the Montreux, Switzerland International Jazz Festival (once with Dizzy Gillespie and once with Quincy Jones). He has performed five times at the North Sea Jazz Festival.


          Under the leadership of Associate Professor Dr. James Patterson, the Clark Atlanta University Jazz Orchestra continues to carry on the Clark Atlanta University Jazz Legacy.
