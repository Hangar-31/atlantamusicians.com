      Every day the AFM helps thousands of musicians — negotiating fair
      agreements, protecting ownership of recorded music, securing benefits such
      as health care and pension, or lobbying our legislators. The AFM is
      committed to raising industry standards and placing the professional
      musician in the foreground of the cultural landscape.


      Organized in 1901, the Atlanta Federation of Musicians is a significant chapter of the AFM representing around 700 musicians throughout Georgia, including the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Athens, Augusta, Columbus and Macon. Our professional members perform every imaginable style of music – including blues, classical, country, ethnic/world music, hip-hop, jazz, rap, rock, soul.

        title: President
        text: >
          BRUCE KENNEY joined the Atlanta Federation of Musicians in 1985, and
          has served as President since 2015. He first joined the AFM Houston
          local in 1975, working as a bass guitarist. Shifting to orchestral
          work as a French horn player, he eventually joined the Atlanta
          Symphony. 

          His freelance years depended on per service income in pop and classical performance. Working freelancers in all genres stand to benefit greatly from collaborative thinking, and the AFM provides the needed structure. For specific workplaces, AFM collective bargaining agreements further solidify terms of employment. 

          His goal as President is to get the right conversations in progress so that musicians can decide how best to deal with the concerns of their professional lives. He encourages the Board to examine, with an open mind, ways to identify and inspire these voices.

          Associate Professor Dr. Patterson earned his BA Degree in Music from
