        text: >
          BRUCE KENNEY joined the Atlanta Federation of Musicians in 1985, and
          has served as President since 2015. He first joined the AFM Houston
          local in 1975, working as a bass guitarist. Shifting to orchestral
          work as a French horn player, he eventually joined the Atlanta
          Symphony. 

          His freelance years depended on per service income in pop and classical performance. Working freelancers in all genres stand to benefit greatly from collaborative thinking, and the AFM provides the needed structure. For specific workplaces, AFM collective bargaining agreements further solidify terms of employment. 

          His goal as President is to get the right conversations in progress so that musicians can decide how best to deal with the concerns of their professional lives. He encourages the Board to examine, with an open mind, ways to identify and inspire these voices.
