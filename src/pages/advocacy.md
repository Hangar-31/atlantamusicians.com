      By signing up as a member of the Solidarity Team, you are adding your name
      to a list of people that will receive calls to action for AFM campaigns,
      as well as updates about rallies and marches for other unions in need.
      There is no obligation by being on the team, but as union members, our
      voice is our most powerful tool. Adding our Local’s voice will only
      strengthen the state of union membership overall.


      To join, contact our office by phone (404-873-2033) or by email (office@atlantamusicians.com). This is an all-volunteer team meant to stand with many of the unions who have regularly marched in solidarity with the AFM across the country and here in Atlanta in our times of need.


      LEND YOUR SUPPORT TODAY!
