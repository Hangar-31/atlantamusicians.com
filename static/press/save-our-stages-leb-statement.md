  In support of local venues, the AFM campaigned last summer and fall to include
  the much-needed Save Our Stages Act in relief legislation being debated in the
  Senate. The Local Executive Board releases the following statement to mark its
  passage:


  We, the Executive Board of the Atlanta Federation of Musicians, Local 148-462, applaud the passage of the Save Our Stages Act and the aid it will provide to local venues.


  These stages are critical to the cultural life and vitality of our area; they are where musicians and the public meet. These presenters help provide the spark for art to brighten the community.


  It is critical to professional musicians that venues survive and thrive. We encourage promoters to demonstrate commitment to the musicians and employees with whom they partner.


  It is, therefore, our hope that the money provided by these public funds is given with a priority to venues that have demonstrated a history of fair treatment and pay to the musicians who perform there, and to the many staffers who support those performances and those of other performing artists.


  The Save Our Stages initiative will nurture the very roots of our culture, enabling renewal and growth of that most basic human need - Music.
