  Recently, the AFM and the Electronic Media Association reached agreement on a side letter to the Integrated Media Agreement for the 2020-21 season, this agreement takes into account the unique challenges of the COVID work environment. 


  The side letter offers expanded streaming rights for orchestras committing to a percentage of their usual live compensation for the year. The Integrated Media Agreement is the primary Agreement used by Symphony Orchestras for recorded media. In our Local, the Atlanta Symphony, the Atlanta Ballet, and the Atlanta Opera work under the IMA, and all are considering special recording projects for the coming year.


  Unsurprisingly, electronic media is taking a central role across the industry at the moment. 


  Several non-symphonic streaming agreements are also available as detailed in the July Podium, and for this year only, the Music Performance Trust Fund is offering grants for projects meeting specific criteria streamed live through their Facebook feed. 


  For more information, or to apply for one of these grants, contact the Local office.
