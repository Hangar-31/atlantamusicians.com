  #### Previous Winners


  2019\

  Timothy Aucoin`(/center>`


  \    The Atlanta Federation of Musicians presented its first ever Educator Award to member Timothy Aucoin, retiring Orchestra Director at Northview High School. Mr. Aucoin, a well-respected bassist and arranger, has continued to be an active performer in the Atlanta area. President Bruce Kenney and Organizing Task Force member Kerren Berz were on-hand at his final concert to present him with the award.\

  In line with the mission of the Educator Award, Timothy chose to donate his prize to the John H. Head Scholarship Fund.\
       The scholarship program, a long-standing summer ritual for Local 148-462, is meant to encourage and support future professional instrumentalists. Auditions are open to any instrumentalist in Georgia who is a graduating high school senior planning to pursue a career in music, and who has been accepted to a college or university music program.

  Meghan Yost`</center>`


  \    As the challenging new school year began last fall and music educators faced a difficult semester, the Local was proud to recognize Meghan Yost for her dedication to both music education and the personal success of her students.\
       Meghan approaches teaching by seeing the future of her students and giving them the musical tools to push through its challenges, be it during practice or in life. As part of the award, Meghan was gifted a prize of $500 to be put toward a music education cause of her choice. With her award, she specifically chose to work with Atlanta Music Project, an organization dedicated to intensive, tuition-free music education for underserved youth in Atlanta, to set up a scholarship fund to sponsor students attending their annual AMP Summer Series.\
