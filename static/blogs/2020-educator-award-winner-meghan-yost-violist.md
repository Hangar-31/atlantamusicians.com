  As the new school year begins and music educators face a difficult semester,
  our Local Executive Board and Organizing Task Force are extremely proud to
  present our Second Annual Educator Award to Local 148-462 member Meghan Yost. 


  Nominated by her peers within the Local throughout last Spring, Meghan was selected as the winner for her dedication to music education and her pursuit of professional development to be a true example of excellence for her students. Meghan approaches teaching by seeing the future of her students and giving them the musical tools to push through its challenges, be it during practice or in life. 


  As part of the award, Meghan was gifted a prize of $500 to be put toward a music education cause of her choice. With this award, she specifically chose to work with Atlanta Music Project, an organization dedicated to intensive, tuition-free music education for underserved youth in Atlanta, to set up a scholarship fund to sponsor students going through their annual AMP Summer Series.
